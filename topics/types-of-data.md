# Types of Data

In this course, we work with different types of data. Knowing the type helps you choose the right chart, summary, or model.

---

## 1) Qualitative (Categorical) Data
These describe **qualities or labels**, not amounts.

### Nominal (no order)
- Examples: major, eye color, country, yes/no

### Ordinal (ordered categories)
- Examples: satisfaction (low/medium/high), class rank (freshman/sophomore/junior/senior)

---

## 2) Quantitative (Numerical) Data
These are numbers that represent **amounts**.

### Discrete (counted)
- Examples: number of students, number of books, number of logins

### Continuous (measured)
- Examples: time, height, temperature, GPA (often treated as continuous)

## Quick Practice
Decide the data type:

1. Favorite music genre  
2. Number of siblings  
3. Satisfaction rating (1–5)  
4. Time spent studying (minutes)  
5. Letter grade (A, B, C, D, F)

## Python Tip
In Python (Pandas), categorical columns often have `object` or `category` dtype, and numeric columns are usually `int` or `float`.
