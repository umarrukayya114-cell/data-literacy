# Data Distributions

A data distribution shows **how values in a dataset are spread out**.
Understanding distributions helps you describe data and choose the right charts and analyses.

## Why Data Distributions Matter
Data distributions help you:
- Understand typical values
- Identify unusual values (outliers)
- Compare groups
- Decide which summary statistics to use

---

## Common Distribution Shapes

### 1) Symmetric Distribution
- Data is evenly spread around the center
- Mean ≈ Median

**Example:** adult heights (approximately)

---

### 2) Right-Skewed Distribution (Positive Skew)
- Long tail on the right
- Most values are smaller
- Mean > Median

**Example:** income, house prices

---

### 3) Left-Skewed Distribution (Negative Skew)
- Long tail on the left
- Most values are larger
- Mean < Median

**Example:** exam scores when most students do well

---

### 4) Uniform Distribution
- All values occur with similar frequency

**Example:** rolling a fair die

---

### 5) Bimodal Distribution
- Two distinct peaks
- Often indicates two groups in the data

**Example:** test scores from two different classes

---

## Common Charts for Distributions
- Histogram
- Boxplot
- Density plot

## Quick Practice
For each situation, predict the distribution shape:

1. Household income  
2. Scores on a very easy quiz  
3. Heights of adult women  
4. Random numbers generated between 1 and 10

## Python Tip
In Python, you can visualize distributions using:
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas.DataFrame.hist()`
